# Compact Docker server for Mautic

Based on [dirtsimple/php-server](https://github.com/dirtsimple/php-server), and inspired by [mingfang/docker-mautic](https://github.com/mingfang/docker-mautic), this container is an alpine nginx+php 7.1 runner for Mautic 2.15.1+ that stores all configuration and data in a separate location from the application code, allowing the use of a proper data volume or mapped directory.  Unlike most mautic distributions, cron jobs are handled *sequentially* and *intelligently*, so that jobs cannot interfere with each other -- including slow runs of the same job.

In addition to the environment variables supported by dirtsimple/php-server, it also supports settings for:

* `MAUTIC_PRS` -- a space-separate list of Mautic PR ids to apply when the container starts.  (This can also be set as a build argument, `BUILD_PRS`.)
* `MAUTIC_JOBS` -- a space separated list of `mautic:` jobs to be run by cron, in execution order. Defaults to:
  * `segments:update`
  * `import`
  * `campaigns:rebuild`
  * `campaigns:trigger`
  * `messages:send`
  * `emails:send`
  * `email:fetch`
  * `social:monitoring`
  * `webhooks:process`
  * `broadcasts:send`
  * `reports:scheduler`
* `MAUTIC_JOB_OPTS` -- options to pass when running the above jobs; defaults to `--no-interaction`
* `MAUTIC_JOB_TIMES` -- minutes at which jobs should be run; defaults to `*/5`, i.e., every five minutes
* `MAUTIC_DATA` -- a directory under which all the instance's configuration, data, translations, media, logs, and cache will be stored; defaults to the volume `/data`.  (Note: If you change this, you will also need to update the `NGINX_WRITABLE` variable to include the new value instead of `/data`; see the `Dockerfile` for the other values that should be included in `NGINX_WRITABLE`.)

In addition to the above, you can also configure various Mautic settings (e.g. database/SMTP/queue parameters) using environment variables; see the [parameters_local.php file](docker/tpl/code/app/config/parameters_local.php) for a current list.  If it's not clear what value should be used for a given environment variable, you can configure the setting(s) via Mautic's UI and then inspect the `config/local.php` file in your `$MAUTIC_DATA` volume to find the values.  Values set via environment variables override those set via the UI.

### Patches and Pull Requests

Because Mautic sometimes has issues that you may need PRs or custom patches to address, this image supports applying patches automatically.  You can list a series of Github PR numbers as a build argument (e.g. `docker build  --build-args BUILD_PRS="7046 7399" .`), or as an environment variable on a specific container (in the `MAUTIC_PRS` environment variable.)

Of course, not all patches you may need to apply are available on Github, so this image automatically applies any patches found in a subdirectory of the container's `/patch-sets/` directory.  For example, if you mount a directory as `/patch-sets/my-patches`, then any `*.patch` files in that directory will also be applied.

Applied patches are copied to `/applied-patches`, and are not reapplied unless the container is recreated or the patch files' contents change.  (Note that changing a patch may result in the patch not being able to be applied, unless you first un-apply the old patch or recreate the container.)

### Usage example

Here is an example of docker-compose.yml which runs Mautic with traefik against external database:

```
version: '3.3'

services:
    mautic:
        image: dirtsimple/mautic-server:2.15.1
        environment:
            DB_PDO_DRIVER: 'pdo_mysql'
            DB_HOST: 'db'
            DB_PORT: '3306'
            DB_NAME: mautic
            DB_USER: mautic
            DB_PASSWORD: 'changeme'
            MAUTIC_FROM_NAME: 'changeme'
            MAUTIC_FROM_EMAIL: 'changeme'
            MAUTIC_MAIL_TRANSPORT: 'smtp'
            MAUTIC_MAIL_HOST: 'changeme'
            MAUTIC_MAIL_PORT: '587'
            MAUTIC_MAIL_USER: 'changeme'
            MAUTIC_MAIL_PASSWORD: 'changeme'
            MAUTIC_MAIL_ENCRYPTION: 'tls' #tls | ssl
            MAUTIC_MAIL_AUTH: 'plain' #plain | login | cram-md5
            MAUTIC_MAIL_SPOOL: 'memory' #memory=immediate, file=queue
            MAUTIC_SECRET_KEY: 'changeme'
            MAUTIC_BASE_URL: 'https://changeme'
            MAUTIC_LOCALE: 'en_US'
        volumes:
            - /opt/data/mautic:/data
        extra_hosts:
            - 'db:172.17.0.1'
        networks:
            - webproxy
        labels:
            - "traefik.enable=true"
            - "traefik.backend=mautic"
            - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:changeme"
            - "traefik.port=80"
            - "traefik.docker.network=webproxy"

networks:
    webproxy:
        external: true
```
